# Frogger
I Recreated my own version of Frogger, and it's horrible. 

Frogger (フロッガー, Furoggā) is a 1981 arcade game developed by Konami and originally published by Sega.[2] In North America, it was published jointly by Sega and Gremlin Industries. The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of hazards.

Frogger was positively received and followed by several clones and sequels. By 2005, Frogger, in its various home video game incarnations, had sold 20 million copies worldwide, including 5 million in the United States.[3] The game found its way into popular culture, including television and music.
